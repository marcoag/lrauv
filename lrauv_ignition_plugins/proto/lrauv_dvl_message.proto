/// \brief Message for a Doppler Velocity Log. Doppler velocity logs are
/// used by the maritime community to track the velocity of a vessel. It relies
/// on the principle of doppler shift of an echo to measure the velocity of the
/// craft.
/// The message is based upon the message in the following repository:
/// https://github.com/apl-ocean-engineering/hydrographic_msgs/blob/main/acoustic_msgs/msg/Dvl.msg
